Big O complexity of algorithms:

insertItem- O(n) because we must iterate through the list to add the item in sorted order

deleteItem- O(n) because we must iterate through the list to delete the item

length- O(n) because we must iterate through the list to find the length

print- O(n) because we must iterate through the list once to print

printReverse- O(n) because we must iterate through the list twice to print the reverse 

deleteSubsection- O(n) because we have to iterate the list to find the items in the range and delete them

reverseList- O(n) because we have to iterate from the start and switch back and front pointers

swapAlternate- O(n) because we just have to iterate through the list once
